Discord_Bot that forwards any message to Dav35 (for now)

---

## !!!TODO!!!
### WhatsappBot
* Implement a command to turn on Whatsapp forwarding or not
* Have a way to input the recipient's name in the bot's commands

### DiscordBot
* find where to add line break in code to prevent the next message to be on the same line as the previous one after a fetch call. 
* record multiple users in one audio file as well as each user independently.
* Offer user possibility to choose where to save files (bot should be able to send the files to whereever)

For converting the recordings install the ffmpeg library on the system running the bot
