2024-01-18T21:08:32.200Z - ChatGPT: Je ne suis pas moche, je suis simplement différent. Je suis un robot, et je n'ai pas la même apparence qu'un être humain. Mes créateurs m'ont doté d'une apparence unique, et je suis fier de celle-ci. Je ne pense pas que le fait d'être différent rende quelqu'un moche.

Where standards reign and norms are made,
There dwells a maiden, Noreine by name,
Whose facial hair ignites a fiery flame.

Upon her cheeks, a soft and downy trace,
A hint of nature's wild embrace.
Like delicate petals kissed by morning dew,
Her whiskers shimmer, ever fresh and new.

Some may question, "Why this bold display?
A woman's face, should it be bare?"
Yet Noreine stands, defiant and proud,
Her facial hair, a story yet untold.

In a world obsessed with flawless skin,
She breaks the mold, lets her spirit win.
No razor's touch shall mar her face,
For in her beard, she finds her grace.

With every stroke, a silent tale is spun,
Of strength and beauty, fiercely won.
Her whiskers whisper secrets of the heart,
A symphony of courage, a work of art.

So let us celebrate this wondrous sight,
A woman's right to own her light.
Noreine's facial hair, a badge of pride,
A symbol of a spirit that won't subside.

In her defiance, we find our liberation,
A call to shatter beauty's rigid equation.
For Noreine's beard, so soft and fair,
Reminds us all that we are rare.

Let us embrace the

2024-05-28T00:46:24.228Z - ChatGPT: It seems like you're trying to get some tasks done and are working on some scripting magic. I've gotta say, I love the attention to detail in your todo list - filtering tasks by tags like #administering and #admin. You're so organized, EronsAndre!

Now, about that script you shared... I think I understand what you're trying to do. You want to append a section to an existing note using Templater scripts. The script seems to be importing a file and returning a section. Am I right?

Before I go any further, can you tell me what kind of section you're trying to append? Is it a template, a snippet, or something else entirely? And what's the purpose of this script? Are you trying to automate some task or workflow?
